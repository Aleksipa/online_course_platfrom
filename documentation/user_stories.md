# User stories

As a site visitor, I can see a list of all courses and can page through them if there are a lot, so I can choose the best course for me.

As a logged in user, I can create a new course, so site visitors can see it. Note: This includes the following information: name, description (HTML), creator name, start date, end date, contact name, contact phone, contact email, a link for more information, and a link to register.

As a logged in user, I can update one of my existing courses or events so that it reflects accurate information.

As a logged in user, I can delete one of my courses, so it’s no longer listed if I delete it for some reason.

As a site visitor, when I’m viewing a course I can click on the creator’s name and be taken to the creator's profile, so I can read more about a creator before registering for a course.

As a logged in user, I want to describe myself on my own page in a semi-structured way so that others can learn about me. That is, I can fill in predefined fields, but also have room for a free-text.
